# DCTAPTemplateForGoogleSheets
The [DC TAP Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A1l2ouF07yXWpHzeA6d6j9FRmXIxrcPsRCEbTvgTNKQ/edit?usp=sharing) is a Google sheet designed to be copied and used as a template for creating [Tabular Application Profiles](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap). It goes beyond the core TAP model to provide a sheets for: metadata about the TAP; prefixes used in compact URIs; information about shapes; and default values for TAP and other properties. This is all the information needed by the [TAP2SHACL](https://github.com/philbarker/TAP2SHACL) python program to create a SHACL representation of the application profile.

There is [an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UkYPGkRo9pcxQYZG9E460pMg_WjKAoJO-Z6gwQXXl6M/edit?usp=sharing) of this template used to record the information used in the simple book example from the [DCTAP Primer](https://github.com/dcmi/dctap/blob/main/TAPprimer.md).
